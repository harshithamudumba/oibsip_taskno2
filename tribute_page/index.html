            A.R. Rahman, born as A. S. Dileep Kumar on January 6, 1967, in
            Chennai, India, is a renowned Indian musician, composer, and music
            producer. He is often referred to as the "Mozart of Madras" and is
            one of the most celebrated and influential figures in the global
            music industry. Rahman was born into a musically inclined Tamil
            family, with his father being a composer and conductor for Tamil and
